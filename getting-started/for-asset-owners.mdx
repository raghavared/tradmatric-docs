## How to List Your Asset

### Step 1: Prepare Asset Details

Gather:
- **High-quality photos** (up to 50 images)
- **Asset description** and key features
- **Verification documents** (proof of ownership)
- **Valuation report** (recent appraisal)

### Step 2: Calculate Pricing

Choose your strategy:

```
Example 1: Quick Sellout
$500,000 Property
100 tickets × $5,000 = $500,000
Higher ticket price = Faster sellout

Example 2: Maximum Reach
$500,000 Property  
5,000 tickets × $100 = $500,000
Lower ticket price = More participants
```

<Tip>
  **Sweet Spot**: $50-$200 per ticket tends to sell fastest while maximizing participation
</Tip>

### Step 3: Create Listing

1. **Contact Our Team**: Reach out to TradMatrix support
2. **Schedule Consultation**: Book a call to discuss your asset
3. **Submit Asset Details**:
   - Asset name and description
   - High-quality images (up to 50)
   - Proof of ownership documents
   - Desired number of tickets
   - Preferred cost per ticket (in USDC)
4. **Team Review**: Our experts verify and optimize your listing
5. **Asset Goes Live**: We handle the blockchain deployment

### Step 4: Monitor Sales

Track in real-time:
- Tickets sold / remaining
- Sales velocity
- Time to sellout (estimated)
- Buyer demographics

### Step 5: Winner Selection

When sold out:
1. **Notification** sent to you
2. **Click "Pick Winner"** in dashboard
3. **Approve Transaction** for VRF randomness
4. **Winner announced** publicly
5. **Funds distributed** automatically

### Step 6: Receive Payout

Automatic settlement:
- **98.5%** of total ticket revenue → Your wallet
- **1.5%** platform fee deducted
- **Instant** USDC payment
- **No waiting** period

## Pricing Strategy

### Calculate Optimal Ticket Count

```javascript
assetValue = $500,000
targetTicketPrice = $100

numberOfTickets = assetValue / targetTicketPrice
                = $500,000 / $100
                = 5,000 tickets

Expected Payout = assetValue × 0.985
                = $492,500
```

### Comparison with Traditional Sales

| Method | Time | Net Amount | Fees |
|--------|------|------------|------|
| **TradMatrix** | 2-4 weeks | $492,500 | 1.5% |
| Real Estate Agent | 6-12 months | $470,000 | 6% |
| Auction House | 1-3 months | $400,000 | 10-25% |
| Private Sale | 12+ months | $500,000 | 0% but slow |
