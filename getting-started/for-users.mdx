## Understanding Probability

Your win chance is simple math:

```
Probability = (Your Tickets) / (Total Tickets Remaining)
```

### Examples

Asset with 5,000 tickets:

| Your Tickets | Investment | Win Probability |
|--------------|------------|-----------------|
| 1 | $100 | 0.02% |
| 10 | $1,000 | 0.20% |
| 50 | $5,000 | 1.00% |
| 100 | $10,000 | 2.00% |

<Tip>
  **Strategy**: Spread investments across multiple assets for diversification, or concentrate on one for higher individual odds.
</Tip>
