## The Problem

Traditional asset ownership has significant barriers:
- **High upfront costs** - Most people cannot afford luxury assets

## The Solution

TradMatrix creates a win-win marketplace where:
- **Asset owners** can quickly liquidate their assets at fair value

Owner Receives: $492,500 (98.5%)
Platform Fee: $7,500 (1.5%)
Winner Gets: $500,000 property
```
