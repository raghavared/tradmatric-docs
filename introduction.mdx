# Welcome to Tradmatrix

Tradmatrix is a decentralized asset ownership platform built on Solana blockchain, enabling fractional participation in real-world assets through a token-based distribution system with provably-fair winner selection.

## Platform Overview

## Core Features

### Token-Based Participation
Purchase tokens for fractional ownership opportunities. Each token represents an equal probability in the selection mechanism. The system ensures transparent token numbering, automated distribution, and cryptographic fairness.

### Cryptographic Randomness
Winner selection uses the Entropy protocol's commit-reveal scheme combined with Solana slot hashing. This ensures that no single party—neither the platform, validators, nor participants—can predict or manipulate the outcome.

### Automated Settlement
Once all tokens are distributed, the winner is selected automatically using verifiable randomness. Platform fees are deducted transparently (1.5%), with the remaining proceeds (98.5%) distributed to the asset owner.

### Seamless Wallet Integration
Connect with popular Solana wallets including Phantom, Solflare, and others. Sign transactions directly from your wallet without sharing private keys.

### Real-time Monitoring
Track asset status, token sales, and transaction progress through an intuitive dashboard with live updates.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Asset Creation">
    Asset owners create a participation event by specifying the asset details, number of available tokens, and token price in USDC.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Token Acquisition">
    Participants purchase tokens using USDC tokens. Each token represents an equal chance in the fair selection mechanism.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Distribution Trigger">
    Once all tokens are sold, the system automatically initiates the winner selection process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cryptographic Selection">
    The Entropy protocol performs verifiable randomness generation using pre-committed secrets and Solana slot hashes to select the winner.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Settlement">
    Winner is announced, proceeds are distributed (platform receives 1.5% fee, asset owner receives 98.5%), and ownership transfer is recorded on-chain.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security Model

### Cryptographic Guarantees
- **Provably Fair**: Winner selection uses cryptographic randomness that cannot be predicted or manipulated
- **Non-Repudiation**: All transactions are signed and recorded on immutable blockchain
- **No Private Key Exposure**: Wallet transactions signed locally, keys never shared

### On-Chain Validation
- Account ownership verification for all transaction signers
- Status validation preventing invalid state transitions
- Arithmetic overflow protection using checked operations
- Constraint-based permission system for sensitive operations

### Backend Security
- JWT-based authentication with time-bound tokens
- Wallet signature verification for ownership proof
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- CORS restrictions for browser-based requests
- Environment-based secret management
