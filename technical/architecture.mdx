# Tradmatrix System Architecture

## Overview

Tradmatrix is a provably-fair asset ownership distribution platform built on Solana. The system enables fractional asset participation through ticket-based distribution with cryptographically verified winner selection using the Entropy protocol's commit-reveal scheme.

<Note>
**Key Innovation**: The Entropy commit-reveal scheme, combined with Solana's slot hashing, ensures that no single party can predict or manipulate the winner selection outcome.

## System Layers

### Layer 1: On-Chain Smart Contracts (Solana)

The Solana program manages all critical operations including asset creation, ticket distribution, and provably-fair winner selection.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Core Instructions">
    **6 Primary Instructions**
    - `create_tradmatrix` - Initialize platform (admin-only, one-time)
    - `create_asset` - Create participation event with tickets and pricing
    - `init_user` - Onboard participant
    - `buy_ticket` - Purchase participation ticket
    - `pick_winner` - Select winner using provably fair algorithm, distribute proceeds
    - `settle_winner` - Record winner's wallet address
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Entropy Instructions">
    **7 Randomness Instructions**
    - `open_var` - Initialize randomness account with commit hash
    - `update_end_at` - Set target slot for randomness sampling
    - `sample_var` - **PERMISSIONLESS** - Capture Solana slot hash

  </Tab>
</Tabs>


## Data Model

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Asset">
    ```typescript
    {
      assetId: number,
      status: "ACTIVE" | "SOLD_OUT" | "COMPLETED",
      numberOfTickets: number,
      ticketCost: number (in lamports),
      ticketsSold: number,
      assetOwner: PublicKey,
      proceeds: bigint,
      winner?: PublicKey
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Ticket">
    ```typescript
    {
      ticketNumber: number, // 1-indexed: 1 to numberOfTickets
      assetId: number,
      owner: PublicKey,
      isPurchased: boolean,
      isWon?: boolean,
      purchasedAt: Date
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="User">
    ```typescript
    {
      wallet: PublicKey,
      username: string,
      createdAt: Date,
      totalTickets: number
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Entropy Secret">
    ```typescript
    {
      assetId: number,
      commit: Buffer,    // 32 bytes (keccak256 hash)
      seed: Buffer,      // 32 bytes (encrypted with AES-256-GCM)
      iteration: number,
      createdAt: Date,
      revealedAt?: Date
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Transaction Flow

### Phase 1: Platform Initialization

<Steps>
  <Step title="create_tradmatrix">
    Admin initializes global program state. One-time operation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Phase 2: Asset & Randomness Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="create_asset + open_var (Batched)">
    Admin creates participation event and initializes randomness account with cryptographic commitment.

    **Batching Benefit**: Atomic initialization ensures randomness account exists before any operations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Phase 3: Ticket Sales

<Steps>
  <Step title="User 1: init_user + buy_ticket (Batched)">
    First participant creates account and purchases ticket. Operations batched for efficiency.
  </Step>
  <Step title="User N: buy_ticket (Sequential)">
    Subsequent participants submit separate transactions to avoid write conflicts on `ticketsSold` counter.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Auto-Status Transition">
    When final ticket sells, asset status automatically transitions to `SOLD_OUT`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Phase 4-8: Cryptographic Winner Selection

The Entropy protocol ensures fair selection through a commit-reveal scheme:

```
[Asset Sold Out]
        ↓
[5s Safety Buffer]
        ↓
TX4: update_end_at (set target slot)
        ↓
[~5 seconds for slot progression]
        ↓
TX5: sample_var (PERMISSIONLESS - capture slot hash)
        ↓
TX6: reveal_var (reveal pre-committed seed)
        ↓
TX7: pick_winner (compute winner from random value)
        ↓
TX8: settle_winner (record winner address)
```

**Timeline**: 15-20 seconds from sold out to winner settled

## Provably Fair Algorithm

### Commit-Reveal Scheme

The system prevents any party from predicting the winner:

**Commitment Phase** (Asset Creation):
1. Entropy provider generates random 32-byte seed
2. Compute commit = keccak256(seed)
3. Pass commit hash to `open_var` instruction

**Reveal Phase** (After Randomness Available):
1. Entropy provider reveals the pre-committed seed
2. Verify: keccak256(revealed_seed) == original_commit
3. Compute final random value: keccak256(slot_hash || seed || iterations)

**Security Properties**:
- ✅ Entropy provider cannot predict slot_hash at commit time (300+ validators control)
- ✅ Solana validators cannot predict seed (locked in commitment hash)
- ✅ Each party controls independent randomness source
- ✅ Final value combines both sources unpredictably

### Seed Encryption

Seeds are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM:

```
Encrypted = IV (16 bytes) || AuthTag (16 bytes) || Ciphertext
```

**Purpose**: Protects against premature revelation if database is compromised

## Ticket Numbering

Tickets use 1-based indexing for user-friendly display:

### Implementation

```
Asset Creation:
  └─ ticketsSold = 0

First Purchase:
  ├─ nextTicketNumber = ticketsSold + 1 = 1
  ├─ PDA seed: ["ticket", assetId, 1]
  ├─ Increment: ticketsSold = 1
  └─ User sees: "Ticket #1"

Final Purchase (100 tickets):
  ├─ nextTicketNumber = ticketsSold + 1 = 100
  ├─ PDA seed: ["ticket", assetId, 100]
  ├─ Increment: ticketsSold = 100
  └─ User sees: "Ticket #100"
```

### Winner Selection Formula

```rust
// On-chain computation
let winning_ticket_number = (random_u64 % ticketsSold) + 1;

// Result: 1-based ticket number matching user's perception
```

The `+1` is critical: modulo produces 0 to (N-1), the +1 converts to 1-based range (1 to N).

## Timing Constraints

### SlotHashes Sysvar Availability

- **Window**: 150 slots (~75 seconds) after target slot
- **Fallback**: Deterministic hash if outside window
- **Mitigation**: Event-driven automation ensures sampling within 10-15 seconds

### Slot Progression Requirements

```
update_end_at(current_slot + 10)
        ↓ [Must wait until current_slot >= target]
sample_var (capture SlotHash)
        ↓ [Immediate]
reveal_var (derive final random value)
        ↓ [Immediate]
pick_winner (select winner)
```

## Transaction Batching Rules

### ✅ Always Batch

| Instructions | Reason |
|--------------|--------|
| `create_asset + open_var` | Randomness must be initialized with asset |
| `init_user + buy_ticket` | User → immediate participation |

### ❌ Never Batch

| Instructions | Reason | Solution |
|--------------|--------|----------|
| Multiple `buy_ticket` | Both mutate `ticketsSold` | Submit separate sequential TXs |
| `update_end_at + sample_var` | Must wait for target slot | ~5 second delay between |
| `sample_var + reveal_var` | Censorship resistance | Permissionless separation |
| `pick_winner + settle_winner` | Event-driven async | Backend reads WinnerSelected event |

**Why separate sample_var + reveal_var?**
- sample_var is permissionless; batching breaks this principle
- Maintains audit trail with separate on-chain entries
- Prevents timing violations if slots progress unexpectedly

**Why separate pick_winner + settle_winner?**
- pick_winner emits winning ticket number on-chain
- Backend listens for WinnerSelected event
- Backend then submits settle_winner with event data
- Eliminates backend winner calculation; uses on-chain value

## Performance Characteristics

### Transaction Throughput

- **Ticket Purchases**: Sequential per asset (ticketsSold conflicts)
- **Users**: Parallel (independent wallets)
- **Assets**: Parallel (independent asset accounts)
- **Randomness Flow**: Sequential (inter-instruction dependencies)

### Latency

```
Single Ticket Purchase: 0.5-2 seconds
Sold Out → Winner: 15-20 seconds (automated)
Total per Event: 15-25 seconds from final ticket
```

### Database Operations

- **Event Processing**: ~100 writes per event cycle
- **Entropy Storage**: 1 record per asset (32 bytes seed + overhead)
- **Activity Logging**: ~15 entries per event cycle

## Event Processing

The backend subscribes to 13 blockchain events:

| Event | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `tradmatrixCreated` | Platform initialized |
| `assetCreated` | Asset created |
| `userInitialized` | Participant onboarded |
| `ticketPurchased` | Ticket acquired |
| `assetSoldOut` | Triggers randomness automation |
| `varOpened` | Randomness account created |
| `varEndAtUpdated` | Triggers sampling automation |
| `varSampled` | Triggers reveal automation |
| `varRevealed` | Triggers winner selection |
| `varNext` | Seed chaining for backup |
| `samplesIncreased` | Iterations added |
| `varClosed` | Randomness cleanup |
| `winnerSelected` | Winner determined, funds distributed |
| `winnerSettled` | Winner confirmed |

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Transaction Retry Strategy

```
Attempt 1: Immediate
Attempt 2: Wait 1 second
Attempt 3: Wait 2 seconds  
Attempt 4: Wait 4 seconds
Maximum: 4 total attempts
```

### Timing Violations

If SlotHashes window exceeded:
- Program uses fallback deterministic hash
- Alert triggers in monitoring
- Randomness still valid but reduced entropy
- Retry with `next_var` for better randomness

### Backup: Blockchain Polling

Event listener failures trigger polling-based backup:
- Runs every 60 seconds
- Syncs all ACTIVE/SOLD_OUT assets
- Catches events missed by real-time listener
